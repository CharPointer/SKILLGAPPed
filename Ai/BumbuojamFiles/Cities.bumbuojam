Okay, I've reviewed the data summary.  I think the most interesting relationships to explore here are related to the population distribution across different countries. Let's use a bar chart to visualize the average population for each country.

```
TYPE: BARCHART
TITLE: "Average Population by Country"
X: country
X_name: "Country"
Y: MEAN(population)
Y_name: "Average Population"
COLOR: COUNT()
COLOR_name: "Number of Cities"
BARMODE: group
```
